#Smichal's Ebook Reader

An ebook reader chrome packaged app that suits my specific needs.

I made it for 2 reasons:

1) I have customized the theme to my specific needs (colors,font-sizes,line-heights,etc...)
2) It parses special text (i.e text between double quotes, brackets, etc) and displays it with different style

What it has:

1) .epub file only support
2) a few themes (you can define more in themes/scss)
3) a simple local file chooser (no url support atm)
4) a simple library that automatically stores what books you've opened and what page you left them at
5) basic font handling (increase/decrease/reset size)
6) automatically saves the scroll height you are at

keyboard shortcuts:

ctrl + mouse wheel: changes font size
ctrl + (+) or (-): changes font size
ctrl + (0): resets font-size

Notes:

1) The reader is based on a modified version EPUB js library, since it normally won't work in chrome apps.
It can be buggy at times, but it works well for me 99% of what I've tried.
2) The paging can be a bit fuzzy at times, what I mean is some books might be shown as only having 4 giant pages or similar,
but since scroll height is automatically saved I don't mind it much.
